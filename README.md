# Forecasting_Supply_Needs---A-Regression-Based-Approach
This Project optimizes supply chain performance of an FMCG company in the instant noodles market, addressing supply-demand mismatches in warehouses. It compares linear regression and multiple linear regression models with and without interaction and quadratic terms to predict the optimal product shipment weights.

Project Highlights

**Objective:**
Minimize inventory costs while meeting regional demand by predicting optimal product shipment weights across warehouses.

**Dataset:**
25,000 records with 24 variables, thoroughly cleaned and preprocessed for modeling.

**Techniques Used:**

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering: Introduced quadratic and interaction terms
- Model Comparison: Linear Regression vs. Multiple Linear Regression (with and without interaction/quadratic terms)
- Model Validation: K-Fold Cross-Validation
- Diagnostics: Residual analysis, multicollinearity check (VIF)

Key Results:
- Achieved Adjusted RÂ² of 89.76%, indicating high model accuracy.
- Identified that storage constraints and transportation challenges significantly impact shipment weight decisions.

Deliverables:
- Code: R scripts for data processing, hypothesis testing, model development, and diagnostics
- Report: In-depth documentation of methodology, findings, and business implications
- Presentation: Visual summary for stakeholders
